# spark-tutorial

> intro to spark for parallel programming

For the [`NEUROHACKWEEK`](https://neurohackweek.github.io/nhw2016/) course at University of Washington eScience Institute.

Contents:

```python
slides.md # the slides
iris.txt # a sample data file
plot.png # an example plot
```

Each slide describes a problem we want to solve, provides code for solving in, and shows what the output should be. During the tutorial, we'll code each solution together as a group.

The slides themselves are written in markdown. You can just look at them in a text editor, or view them as a slideshow in your terminal by installing [`tslide`](https://github.com/dominictarr/tslide) with

```
npm install tslide -g
```

Then call

```
tslide slides.md
```
